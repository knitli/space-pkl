# Feature plans
- Implement cli `init` and `validate` commands
- I'm not sure the custom header/footer cli feature is actually implemented. Need to hunt it down...
- We'd ideally like to also package the generated pkl files as a `PklPackage` and version and hang them on the repo so folks could just point their configs to our package instead of generating them themselves.
