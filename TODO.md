# TODO - Hanging Chads for space-pklr; the final frontier

[] Actually implement conversions in config_processor
[] Finish pkl_renderer:
    [] class handling
    [] reference handling

[] Add include_deprecated to cli options
[] Flatten CLI options
[] Implement validation for configs
[] Re-implement Pkl schema testing for generated schema

[] Actually map features to functionality...

[] More integration tests for all of the above
[] Documentation...

## Eventually

[] Open up functionality beyond `moon` config types. The schematic underpinnings allow for it, but we made the choice to strongly type for moon. I think the easy button it just having another command with looser types.
