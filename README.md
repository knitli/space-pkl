# space-pklr

**space-pklr** is a project-in-progress aimed at creating a full-featured renderer for Pkl schemas. It builds on the schematic framework to provide robust support for type annotations, constraints, and idiomatic Pkl formatting.

## Current Status

This project is still under development, and many core features are incomplete. The heart of the project lies in the `PklSchemaRenderer`, which is designed to translate complex schema types into clean, idiomatic Pkl with full type coverage. Key tasks include:

- Implementing rendering for all supported schema types (`Struct`, `Enum`, `Tuple`, etc.).
- Adding support for constraints, defaults, and deprecated types.
- Fine-tuning options for customization, such as indentation and module naming.
- Expanding integration tests for real-world use cases.

## Features (Planned)

- Renders idiomatic Pkl aligned with the [Pkl Style Guide](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/style-guide/index.html).
- Supports complex type annotations and constraints, including enums, tuples, and unions.
- Handles deprecated fields and default values gracefully.
- Includes options for customization, such as module/class structures and commenting out optional fields for templates.

## Why Pkl?

Pkl is a powerful dynamic language purpose-built for configurations. It provides features like type constraints, lazy evaluation, and conditional generation, making it ideal for managing configurations in large-scale applications.
